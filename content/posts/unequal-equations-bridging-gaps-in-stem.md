Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—better known as STEM—is often described as the driving force of progress. They shape every part of our lives, but when we take a  closer look, it becomes apparent  that not everyone has equal access to the opportunities this field offers. Inequality in STEM doesn’t just refer to becoming a doctor or a scientist—it begins much earlier, with challenges regarding access, funding, and politics deeply rooted in every field. This web of hurdles are in reality, a cycle of inequality that affects not just individuals, but society as a whole.

The truth is that a massive percentage of youth, especially those from rural areas, underprivileged communities, or marginalized groups, are left behind when it comes to STEM education. Young people from these communities can't afford to dream of entering STEM, due to it being cut short by a shortage of resources due to lack of funds. Schools with limited resources often struggle to provide even the basics, whereas well-funded schools can provide advanced labs, skilled teachers, and exposure to research opportunities. Access, therefore, becomes a privilege, not a right.

Another layer of inequality emerges from research funding. Much of scientific research depends on grants from governments, corporations, and private institutions, but these funds are often directed towards projects with market value or political approval rather than purely scientific importance. This “market-driven funding” prospect means that not all ideas get equal opportunities. Potentially great research may remain unfunded simply because it doesn’t align with economic or political agendas.

This gap becomes even clearer when comparing India to countries like the United States or those in Europe. Developed nations invest heavily in research, and their students often grow up with easier access to labs, mentorship, and opportunities to pursue cutting-edge ideas. A recent report reveals that 70% of Indian students opting to study abroad are pursuing degrees in STEM fields. Instead of fully harnessing incredible talent demonstrated by the youth, systemic challenges faced by developing countries like India, act as a trajectory of slow progress.

However, an important turning point for India is being marked by programs like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and assistance from groups like the India STEM Foundation. These activities aim to enhance employability and nurture innovators. Even though government initiatives and NGOs are trying to bridge the gap, inequality remains a significant barrier.

Gender inequality adds another dimension to the STEM divide. Women remain particularly underrepresented, making up only 35% of STEM graduates which has remained unchanged for the past decade. They are held back by biases, social norms and expectations, influencing the quality of the education they receive and the subjects they study. Even when they do enter these fields, they often face workplace discrimination, and persistent pay gaps in comparison to their male counterparts. Breaking these barriers is essential, not just for fairness, but also because diverse perspectives enrich research and innovation.

STEM should be about discovery, creativity, and building a better future for all. Yet, inequality continues to shape participation criteria in every field available. At YMA, we believe that empowering students with exposure, mentorship, and equal opportunities is the first step toward ensuring that STEM is not just a luxury for some, but a shared path for many.

Why does this matter in the first place? Because when diversity is excluded from STEM, innovation suffers. New perspectives and solutions are born when people from all backgrounds can contribute their ideas. Inequality in STEM is real, but it isn’t stagnant. Together, through education and empowerment, we can bridge this gap called inequality. When we give every student the chance to explore STEM, we don’t just shape careers—we shape a better world.
