But thanks to the discovery of neuroplasticity, we now know that the brain is constantly changing and adapting throughout life. This breakthrough completely transformed our concept about learning, mental health, and even recovery.\n\nNeuroplasticity is a fancy medical term used to describe our brain’s ability to learn and adapt. It is an internal rewiring process that allows our mind to grow and reorganize itself by forming new neural connections which occur in response to learning, experiences and trauma. Even something as simple as remembering the name of a new classmate involves brainwork that falls under the umbrella of neuroplasticity.\n\nNeuroplasticity isn’t just about learning new stuff, it's our brain’s ability to constantly reprogram, which is essential after a head injury or stroke. It actually brings physical changes inside the cranium. In essence, our brain undergoes a sort of rewiring, and structural changes occur within our brains while learning from our experiences. These synaptic connections essentially create new pathways to work around injuries and make it possible for our brain to bypass damaged areas.\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that every experience we have shapes our brain. Our thoughts, habits and emotions can strengthen some neural pathways while weakening others. This means that with practice and the right environment, we can train our brains to become more focused, manage anxiety and end up developing positive behaviours.\n\nNeuroplasticity is an exciting prospect for students to delve into. Want to make your brain stronger? Then challenge it regularly with new activities and experiences! This means intelligence and abilities aren't stagnant – you can improve them through practice and a change in one’s mindset.\n\nIn a nutshell neuroplasticity proves that our brains are far more flexible than we once thought. As someone interested in both psychology and science communication, I find it inspiring that the brain is always changing and that we have the power to guide that change through how we think, act and learn.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/)\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity](https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity)\n\n[https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/what-is-neuroplasticity-and-why-does-it-matter](https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/what-is-neuroplasticity-and-why-does-it-matter)\n\n[https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-leverage-neuroplasticity-to-maintain-cognitive-fitness-as-you-age](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/tips-to-leverage-neuroplasticity-to-maintain-cognitive-fitness-as-you-age)\n\n[https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity)\n\n[https://www.simplypsychology.org/brain-plasticity.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/brain-plasticity.html)\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neuroplasticity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neuroplasticity)\n","slug":"rewiring-the-brain-the-science-behind-neuroplasticity"},"__N_SSG":true}
